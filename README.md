# FlipDot-Designer
With this program you can:
* Create displays and export as arrays:
  * Format {col1, col2, ... , coln} (each colx is a bitwize representation of the column)
  * Pick where you want your origin (top-left, bottom-left)
* Create display libraries such as numbers, alphabet, fonts, etc...
* Works similar to MS Paint
  * Left click or drag to turn dots on
  * Right click or drag to turn dots off
* Stream data and Export Displays over serial.
* Works with flip dot boards of any size.

Virus total and other scanners will may give a false flag it due to being compiled with pyinstaller.    
You can also just run it from the .py file if you feel unsafe :).
